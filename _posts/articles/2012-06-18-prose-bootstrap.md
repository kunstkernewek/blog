In order to get started with Prose Bootstrap, all you have to do is fork the [repository](http://github.com/?) and make your own adjustments.

# Adjust Configuration

Make sure you setup `_config.yml` correctly.

If your page lives under `http://username.github.com/sitename` update the config.yml like this:

    baseurl: /sitename
        
# Use Prose

Once your site is up you can start managing it with [Prose](http://prose.io). Follow the instructions [here](http://prose.io/help/getting-started.html).

# Add a CNAME file if you want to use your own URL...
