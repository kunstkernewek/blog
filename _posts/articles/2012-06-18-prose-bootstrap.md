# Get setup

Fork the [repository](https://github.com/prose/bootstrap).

If your page lives under `http://username.github.com/sitename` update the config.yml like this:

    baseurl: /sitename

I had to remove the CNAME file as i wasn't using a custom URL.

# Use Prose to make posts

Once your site is up you can start managing it with [Prose](http://prose.io). Follow the instructions [here](http://prose.io/help/getting-started.html).
